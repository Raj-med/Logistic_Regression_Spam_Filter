# Spam Detection Model with API
![](https://github.com/Raj-med/Logistic_Regression_Spam_Filter/blob/main/logistic%20regression.gif)

This project will provide a REST API for detecting spam and non-spam text messages using a logistic regression model. The model is trained to classify text into two categories: **spam** and **not spam**. You can interact with the model through an HTTP API endpoint.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that the model (`model.pkl`) and vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`) files are present in the project directory.

4. Start the Flask application by running:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. The Flask API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## API Endpoints

### `/predict` (POST)

This endpoint receives a POST request with a JSON payload containing a "text" field. It returns a prediction of whether the text is spam or not spam.

**Request Example:**
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Congratulations! Youâ€™ve won a $1000 gift card. Claim your prize now!"}'

# Response Example (Spam):
{
  "prediction": "spam"
}


## NOTES
- Ensure your system is properly configured with the required dependencies (Flask, scikit-learn, pickle, etc.).
- The model uses text input for prediction. Make sure the text provided in the request body is clear and properly formatted.
- Adjust the paths in the script to point to your locally saved model (`model.pkl`) and vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`) files.
- The script expects a POST request with JSON data containing a text field. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Free money! Click here to claim your prize."
  }

- The script handles basic error checking, but for optimal usage, ensure your input follows the expected format.
- If the text field is empty or improperly formatted, the API will return an error response.
- The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled messages (spam and not spam), so predictions are based on patterns in that dataset. If you get unexpected results, consider re-training the model with a more diverse set of examples.
- The model should work in real-time, but ensure the server is running (python app.py) before making requests.
- The script handles basic error checking, but for optimal usage, ensure your input follows the expected format.
